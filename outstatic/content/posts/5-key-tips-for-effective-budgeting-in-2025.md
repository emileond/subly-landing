### **1. Get a Complete Picture of Your Expenses**

Budgeting starts with knowing where your money has gone and where it will go. Review last year’s financials to get a sense of your recurring expenses, one-off costs, and unexpected expenses. Consider setting up **project-based budgeting** to track different aspects of your operations individually, while still seeing the big picture of your total budget.

**Subly Tip:** In Subly, you can create projects to separate and categorize expenses. This makes it easy to get insights into different areas of your budget while still having a clear overview of your business’s financials as a whole.

### **2. Forecast Cash Flow to Avoid Surprises**

A crucial part of budgeting is anticipating your cash flow—knowing when money will be coming in and going out. Build a cash flow forecast based on recurring revenue and expenses, one-off costs, and seasonal trends to help you stay prepared.

**Subly Tip:** Subly’s cash flow forecasting feature provides real-time insights based on your spending patterns, so you can see months ahead and budget accordingly. This proactive view helps you avoid cash shortages and make informed financial decisions throughout the year.

### **3. Plan for Recurring and Variable Expenses**

From monthly subscriptions to quarterly marketing campaigns, it’s important to account for all types of recurring expenses. Also, keep an eye out for expenses that vary, like travel or seasonal inventory, and consider setting aside a contingency budget to handle fluctuations.

**Subly Tip:** Subly makes budgeting for recurring expenses easy by allowing you to add and categorize subscriptions in seconds. The platform even offers a comprehensive list of popular tools, so you don’t have to start from scratch when entering recurring costs.

### **4. Collaborate with Your Team for Accuracy**

Budgeting shouldn’t be a solo task—getting input from team members ensures you’re accounting for the needs of each department. Collaborative budgeting allows team members to contribute insights and ensures that everyone is aligned with the financial plan for the year.

**Subly Tip:** With Subly, you can invite team members to view or contribute to your budgeting process, creating a shared vision for your finances. Whether you’re gathering feedback on marketing expenses or discussing tech upgrades, Subly’s collaborative features make team budgeting simple and secure.

### **5. Don’t Forget Growth and Contingency Funds**

Budgeting isn’t only about covering expenses—it’s about planning for growth. Set aside funds to invest in new projects, marketing efforts, or technology improvements. Additionally, a contingency fund is essential for dealing with unexpected expenses without disrupting your primary budget.

**Subly Tip:** With Subly’s project-based platform, it’s easy to allocate funds to growth and contingency projects, ensuring that you’re prepared for new opportunities and any unforeseen costs.
