As the year winds down, it’s time for business of all sizes to look ahead and plan their next year budget. Budgeting isn’t just about covering expenses; it’s a roadmap that aligns your financial resources with your business objectives, enabling you to navigate growth, investments, and unexpected challenges with confidence. 

Whether you’re running a startup or an established business, these tips will guide you in building a successful budget for 2025, allowing you to make informed decisions and stay on track with your financial goals.

### **1. Get a Complete Picture of Your Expenses**

Budgeting starts with knowing where your money has gone and where it will go. Review last year’s financials to get a sense of your recurring expenses, one-off costs, and any surprise expenses that popped up along the way. Consider setting up project-based budgeting to track different aspects of your operations individually while still seeing the big picture of your total budget.

**Subly Tip**: Subly’s project-based tracking lets you separate and categorize expenses with ease. This makes it simple to gain insights into specific areas of your budget, while keeping a clear overview of your business’s financials as a whole.

### **2. Forecast Cash Flow to Avoid Surprises**

A crucial part of budgeting is anticipating your cash flow—knowing when money will be coming in and going out. Build a cash flow forecast based on recurring revenue, regular expenses, one-off costs, and any seasonal trends to help you stay prepared and avoid surprises.

**Subly Tip**: Use Subly’s Cash Flow Forecast to get you real-time insights based on your spending patterns, so you can look months ahead and budget accordingly. This proactive view helps you avoid cash shortages and make informed financial decisions throughout the year.

### **3. Plan for Recurring and Variable Expenses**

From monthly subscriptions to quarterly marketing campaigns, it’s important to account for all types of recurring expenses. Also, keep an eye out for expenses that vary, like travel or seasonal inventory, and consider setting aside a contingency budget to handle fluctuations.

Budgeting shouldn’t be a solo task—getting input from team members ensures you’re accounting for the needs of each department. Collaborative budgeting allows team members to contribute insights and ensures that everyone is aligned with the financial plan for the year.

**Subly Tip**: With Subly, you can invite team members to view or contribute to your budgeting process, creating a shared vision for your finances.
