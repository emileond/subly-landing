At Subly, the mission has always been to empower SMBs and individuals with great financial tools that help you take informed decisions. That's why I'm excited to announce a significant step forward in our journey: the addition of revenue tracking to Subly.

### Why revenue tracking?

Since its inception, Subly has been a great tool for managing subscriptions and recurring expenses. While this has been incredibly valuable, I realized it was only half the picture. To truly empower you to make informed financial decisions, Subly needs to give you a complete view of your finances. That means not just tracking what goes out, but also what comes in.

Revenue tracking is the first step towards creating a powerful tool that goes beyond managing subscriptions. With this new feature, you can:

- **Track Recurring Revenue:** Monitor your steady income streams effortlessly.
- **Manage One-Time Revenue:** Keep a clear record of those one-off payments.
- **Gain Revenue Insights:** Get insights on your Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) and gross volume for any date range you choose.

### Other updates

In addition to the revenue tracking feature, we’ve made several other improvements to enhance your Subly experience:

- **Custom Date Insights:** Now you can select specific dates to view your outgoings and revenue. Our previous preset options like "monthly" and "quarterly" are still available and can be accessed by clicking on the "use avg" switch.
- **Revamped Filters UI:** We’ve redesigned our filters to be more intuitive and user-friendly, making it easier to navigate and find the data you need.
- **New Ideas Board:** We’ve migrated our ideas board to a new solution. Be sure to visit the new board to vote on existing ideas and share your own. Your feedback is invaluable in shaping the future of Subly.

### What's next?

By integrating revenue tracking, we're laying the foundation for more advanced features that will give you deeper insights into your business. For instance, we can now work on generating cashflow forecasts, helping you understand your financial status at a glance and plan for the future more effectively.
