## Announcing Projects

You can now organize your subscriptions by Projects, and each project has its own set of reports and statistics. You'll have a "Personal" project by default; to add a new project, simply click on the Projects Menu at the top right of Subly and select "Create Project." - This feature is only available in the pro version.

### What can I do with projects?

Projects add another level of organization. Projects are especially useful if you manage services for different purposes. You can keep your personal subscriptions separate from your business/freelance services in this way. This is especially useful for businesses managing services across multiple teams.
