We're excited to announce the release of a few new features that we hope will make managing your subscriptions even easier!

## Search

First, we've added a **quick search** feature that allows you to search for any subscription across your workspace. This makes it easy to find what you're looking for, no matter where it's stored.

## Custom icons

Now you can upload **custom icons** for your subscriptions. This is a great way to personalize your subscription list and make it even easier to find the ones you need.

## Add to calendar

In this release, we've also added an **Add to calendar** button that allows you to export the upcoming payment dates for a subscription to Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or as an iCal file. This is a convenient way to keep track of your subscriptions and ensure you never miss a payment.

## New calendar view

Visualize your recurring expenses in a calendar, displayed by upcoming payment date in the new calendar view.
