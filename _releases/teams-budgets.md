## Invite team members

Subly now allows you to collaborate with your team.
Invite your team members by going to the **Team** page. You can give them access to all of your projects or just a select few.

Newly invited users will get an email invitation to join your workplace.

## Project budget

To help you better manage your subscriptions and stop overspending, we've released project budgets.

With this update, you can now specify a project budget (in any currency), and Subly will inform you of how much money is still available for spending.
