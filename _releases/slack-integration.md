## Slack integration

We are excited to announce a new integration with Slack! Now, users on paid plans will be able to receive payment reminders on their preferred Slack channel.

To take advantage of this new feature, simply connect your Slack workspace to Subly and choose the channel where you want to receive alerts. You can do this by going to the **Integrations** section in the **Settings** page.

We know how busy life can get, and how easy it is to lose track of your subscriptions and recurring expenses. That's why we're dedicated to providing the best experience possible for managing your expenses in the way that works best for you.

So why wait? Try out the new Slack integration today and start enjoying the benefits of staying on top of your subscriptions. And as always, thank you for choosing Subly!
