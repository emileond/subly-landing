## Subly on the dark side

We are excited to announce that Subly now has a dark mode!

Dedicated to to all our users who like being productive in a completely dark environment and want to enjoy their nighttime browsing habits as well.

If you want to activate the dark mode, all you have to do is go into settings and select "dark mode."

This was one of our most requested features, and we hope you enjoy it as much as we do.
