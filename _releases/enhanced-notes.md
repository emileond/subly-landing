## Enhanced notes

We've recently updated our notes engine to offer a block-styled note-taking experience. With this new feature, you'll be able to format your notes related to your subscriptions and recurring expenses with greater ease and flexibility. Here are a few benefits of block-styled notes:

- Customization options: With block-styled notes, you can format your notes the way you want them to be. You can add headings, links, paragraphs, lists, checklists, and images, making it easier to track expenses and stay organized.

- Improved readability: Block-styled notes are designed to be more visually appealing and easier to read than simple text. Now you can make your notes more structured and easier to understand.

- Media support: With block-styled notes, you can easily add images to your notes, making it easier to keep track of important information.
