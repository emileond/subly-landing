## One time expenses

We listened to your feedback and are pleased to announce that you can now add services for which you do not pay on a recurring basis. With this feature now you can use Subly to keep track of the software licenses and lifetime deals that you have.

To add a one-time payment service, simply create a new subscription as usual and select "One time" as the expense type. You can set reminders for refund dates when you add a one-time payment subscription.

## Custom categories

Another frequently requested feature was custom categories; You can now categorize your subscriptions in any way that you want making it easier to adapt Subly to your needs. Simply navigate to the Settings view, and under the General tab, you'll find a "Categories" section where you can add, edit, and delete categories to better organize subscriptions.
