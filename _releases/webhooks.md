Hey there ðŸ‘‹, we're thrilled to announce a new update to Subly, which includes exciting new features, UI updates, and bugfixes to provide a seamless experience for all of our users.

## Webhooks

The highlight of this release is the introduction of Webhooks. This new feature allows you to connect Subly to other applications such as **Zapier**, **Make**, and **IFTTT** and automate tasks based on events within Subly. This opens up a whole new world of possibilities and we can't wait to see how you'll use it!

## Other Updates

In addition to Webhooks, we've also made some other user experience updates to make Subly even easier to use.

### UX updates

- The app now automatically saves your sorting preferences

- UI remembers the search term when you're adding a new service

- Added icons to make navigating the settings tabs a breeze.

### Bug fixes

Bugs squished during this release:

- Fixed an issue with the billing period label

- Fixed a bug that sometimes caused one-time expenses to be counted in the "recurring expenses" calculations

Thank you for your continued support of Subly. If you have any feedback or suggestions, we'd love to hear from you!

Best,
The Subly Team
