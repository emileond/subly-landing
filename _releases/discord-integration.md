We are thrilled to announce a new integration with Discord that allows our users to receive payment reminders on their preferred Discord channel. With this integration, you'll never miss a payment again.

To set up the integration, simply navigate to the **Integrations** section in the **Settings** page. Then, enable the Discord integration and paste the **channel webhook provided by Discord** where you want to receive alerts . It's that easy!

We understand how hectic life can be and how easy it is to lose track of your subscriptions. That's why we're committed to providing the best experience possible for managing your expenses in a way that works for you.

Don't wait any longer to take advantage of this convenient new integration. Connect your Discord server to Subly today and start enjoying the benefits of staying on top of your subscriptions. Thank you for choosing Subly!
